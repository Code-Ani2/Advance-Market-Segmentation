An advanced application that segments customers based on their spending behaviour in various categories. In the output, these details of a customer is displayed using their Customer ID.

## Features
=> **User friendly GUI**: with PyQt5

=> **Machine Learning based segmentation**: uses Autoencoders & K-Means for clustering

=> **Popup Display**: Customer details are shown in a popup window
